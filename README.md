# project-226A
In this project we implemented two numerical algorithms to solve PDEs - neural network and v-cycle multigrid method.

Directory solvers/ contains all the codes for the numerical solvers we use in this paper - Neural network solver, Multigrid solver and traditional Finite difference solver (as a benchmark).
